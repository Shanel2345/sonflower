            <p><b>Sanele Mkhize</b></p>
             <div class="card-back"> 
            <p>Sanele is a passionate follower of Christ, a proud South African, 
            and a servant at heart. He founded Sonflower as a collective Christian movement dedicated 
            to restoring dignity to the lost, the hopeless, and the forgotten—through feeding, clothing, 
            and haircutting the homeless.
            His love for God and people drives everything he does. 
            What started as empathy has become action—a mission to make sure no one is unseen, 
            unloved, or left behind. Faith without action isn’t love. Sonflower is how we love out loud.</p>

        <div class="card-back"> 
            <p>My name is Nicole Malakiya, and I’m passionate about serving people, 
            especially those who are often overlooked. With a heart for people and a 
            deep sense of compassion, I play an active role in organizing food drives, and
            building relationships with those on the streets. Being part of a team that feeds 
            the homeless has opened my heart in ways I never imagined. I believe everyone deserves 
            to be seen, heard, and loved — no matter their story. Through small acts of kindness
            like sharing a warm meal or a genuine conversation, I’ve seen how hope can be restored. 
            My faith plays a big role in everything I do, and I’m committed to living it out by 
            helping others experience the love and dignity they were created for.</p>
